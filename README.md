# Hospital Management Database - Oracle 23c

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive **Hospital Management Database** project built and designed for **Oracle 23c (23ai)** using **SQL Developer**. The database is designed to simulate a full-scale hospital management system with over **103 interrelated tables**, providing a rich environment to practice and master Oracle SQL, advanced features, and relational database design.

The database is structured around a **central table** named `hm_hospital_entities`, which links and references all hospital-related entities such as patients, doctors, nurses, rooms, equipment, surgeries, vehicles, staff, financial records, and more. This centralized approach ensures a unified view of hospital operations and facilitates complex queries, analytics, and reporting.

---





Database Migration

⚠️ Note: This Hospital Management Database was originally designed for Oracle 23c, but it has also been migrated to PostgreSQL.
 All tables, sequences, constraints, and relationships have been adapted to PostgreSQL standards while preserving the original 
 business logic and structure. Users can now run the database in PostgreSQL using the provided scripts in the postgresql folder.




## Features

* Fully relational database structure with **foreign key constraints**, **check constraints**, and **identity columns**.
* Use of **JSON columns** for flexible metadata storage.
* Centralized entity management through `hm_hospital_entities`.
* Example of **department-based relations** and hierarchical management.
* Integration of real-world hospital modules such as:

  * Patient management
  * Staff and payroll management
  * Surgery and operating room scheduling
  * Radiology and physiotherapy sessions
  * Pharmacy and medication transactions
  * Asset tracking and procurement logs
  * Research project and resource allocation
  * Compliance, audits, and quality management
  * Sustainability and energy usage tracking
* Practice of advanced Oracle features such as:

  * `NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY`
  * `CLOB` and `JSON` data types
  * `CHECK` constraints for controlled values
  * Timestamp management for auditing (`created_at`, `updated_at`)
  * Boolean simulation using `CHAR(1)` or `NUMBER(1)`

## Database Schema

### Central Table: `hm_hospital_entities`

```sql
CREATE TABLE hm_hospital_entities (
    entity_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    entity_type VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL CHECK (entity_type IN (
        'PATIENT', 'DOCTOR', 'NURSE', 'ROOM', 'EQUIPMENT', 'SURGERY', 'VEHICLE', 'STAFF', 'OTHER',
        'MEDICAL_RECORD', 'LAB_TEST', 'LAB_RESULT', 'DISEASE_CASE', 'INFECTIOUS_DISEASE',
        'CLINICAL_GUIDELINE', 'GUIDELINE_IMPLEMENTATION', 'PATIENT_CONSENT', 'TELEMEDICINE_SESSION',
        'PATIENT_FEEDBACK', 'INVOICE', 'PAYMENT', 'INSURANCE_CLAIM', 'FINANCIAL_PREDICTION', 'BUDGET',
        'HOSPITAL_EVENT', 'NOTIFICATION', 'ASSET_TRACKING', 'DYNAMIC_SHIFT_ASSIGNMENT', 'SHIFT',
        'ONLINE_PORTAL_USER', 'PORTAL_CONSENT', 'RESEARCH_PROJECT', 'RESEARCH_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION',
        'RESEARCH_RESOURCE', 'CLINICAL_PREDICTION', 'HOSPITAL_GRAPH_NODE', 'HOSPITAL_GRAPH_EDGE',
        'SECURITY_GUARD', 'SECURITY_INCIDENT', 'CLEANING_STAFF', 'CLEANING_SCHEDULE', 'TECHNICAL_STAFF',
        'MAINTENANCE_REQUEST', 'GENERAL_WAREHOUSE', 'TECHNICAL_INVENTORY', 'PHARMACEUTICAL_WAREHOUSE',
        'CAFETERIA_STAFF', 'MEAL_SCHEDULE', 'STAFF_PAYROLL', 'STAFF_BENEFIT', 'PURCHASE_ORDER',
        'PROCUREMENT_LOG', 'VEHICLE', 'AMBULANCE_MISSION', 'IT_STAFF', 'SOFTWARE_LICENSE',
        'MARKETING_CAMPAIGN', 'INTERNATIONAL_PATIENT_LEAD', 'DEPARTMENT_MANAGER',
        'DEPARTMENT_PERFORMANCE_REVIEW', 'RADIOLOGY_SCAN', 'RADIOLOGY_TECHNICIAN',
        'PHYSIOTHERAPY_SESSION', 'PHYSIOTHERAPIST', 'EMPLOYEE_RECORD', 'TRAINING_PROGRAM',
        'CUSTOMER_COMPLAINT', 'PATIENT_SATISFACTION_SURVEY', 'QUALITY_AUDIT', 'COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST',
        'BED', 'ROOM_ALLOCATION', 'INTERN', 'TRAINING_SCHEDULE', 'WASTE_DISPOSAL_LOG', 'WASTE_TYPE',
        'DONATION', 'CHARITY_CASE', 'ENERGY_USAGE_LOG', 'SUSTAINABILITY_INITIATIVE', 'LOG')),
    entity_ref_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    department_id INTEGER,
    entity_metadata JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES hm_departments(department_id)
);
```

* The central table serves as the **hub for all hospital entities**, enabling uniform references across modules.
* All other tables reference this hub either directly or indirectly via foreign keys.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Oracle Database 23c (23ai)**
* **SQL Developer** (latest version recommended)
* Basic knowledge of **SQL**, **PL/SQL**, and **Oracle data types**.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/miladrostami-devjava/Hospital-Management-Database---Oracle-23c.git
```

2. Open SQL Developer and connect to your Oracle 23c database.
3. Execute the SQL scripts in the **order of dependency**:

   * Create `hm_departments` first.
   * Create all reference tables before tables that include **foreign keys**.
   * Create the central table `hm_hospital_entities` last (or as per logical dependency).

### Testing

* Query the tables to validate data integrity:

```sql
SELECT * FROM hm_hospital_entities;
SELECT * FROM hm_physiotherapy_sessions;
SELECT * FROM hm_nurses;
```

* Test **foreign key constraints** by attempting inserts that violate relationships.
* Practice **JSON and CLOB handling** with queries and updates on metadata fields.
